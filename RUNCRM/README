The Chandra Radiation Model (CRM) from Sverdrup/MSFC
is propagated in this directory, and graphical and
tabular data products are updated every 5 minutes 
by cron jobs, to track current and future orbital 
proton flux and fluence.

The following cron jobs are run on rhodes:

21 3 * * * /proj/rac/ops/ephem/ephem.pl
4,9,14,19,24,29,34,39,44,49,54,59 * * * * /proj/rac/ops/CRM3/crm.pl

ephem.pl runs /proj/rac/ops/CRM3/runcrm, which is a FORTRAN 
program that directly calls the CRM model subroutine CRMFLX.

runcrm is run once per day, to generate CRM fluxes at
5-minute intervals (corresponding to the Chandra ephemeris
positions in /proj/rac/ops/ephem/PE.EPH.dat), for the
28 possible Kp values from 0.0 to 9.0

crm.pl runs at 5-minute intervals to track the planned SIM and 
OTG positions, Kp, and the CRM model output, and to generate
the orbital fluence history, both with and without SIM+OTG
attenuation factors. crm.pl also runs the IDL procedure
crmpl2.pro, which generates plots of predicted future 
proton fluence.

Data files: 
CRM_p.datNN - proton flux data from CRM model, where NN = Kp*10 (eg 53 => 5.3)
(each CRM_p.datNN file contains:
 time (seconds from 1998), CRM region, mean flux, 95% flux, 50% flux, flux SD)
CRMarchive.dat - archive of Chandra orbital fluences
CRMsummary.dat - latest summary of Chandra proton flux and fluence
fphist.dat - simplified time sequence of Chandra SIM position,
 currently derived from /export/acis-flight/FLU-MON/FPHIST.dat
grathist.dat - simplified time sequence of Chandra OTG positions,
 curently derived from /export/acis-flight/FLU-MON/GRATHIST.dat
